Caveats:
"1. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"

"2. About national population figures: population figures for 1999 are from the 1990-1999 series of bridged-race intercensal"
"estimates of the July 1 resident population; population figures for 2000 and 2010 are bridged-race April 1 census counts;"
"population figures for 2001-2009 are from the revised 2000-2009 series of bridged-race intercensal estimates of the July 1"

"resident population that is under one year of age. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Age Group."
"4. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"

"5. Changes to cause of death classification affect reporting trends. More information:"
