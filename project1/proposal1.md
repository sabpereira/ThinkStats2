# The Contribution of the Opioid Epidemic on the Falling Life Expectancy in the US#### Sabrina Pereira## Project Exploration DescriptionFor my first project, I hope to gain insight into the opioid epidemic and any impact it may have on the life expectancy in the US. I would like to explore the differences in the survey results over the years, and how this matches up with the timeline of the opioid epidemic. One approach I am considering taking is to find out if I can remove the effect of the deaths due to opioid abuse in the life expectancy calculation to see how much these deaths weigh in the calculation. ## Data to ExploreI plan to explore the data from the CDC's National Vital Statistics System (NVSS, Links: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/deaths.htm, https://wonder.cdc.gov/mortSQL.html), and possibly the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH, Links: https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm, https://pdas.samhsa.gov/#/) as well.I have not yet downloaded the data, but I believe they can be found at the above links.## Data Use Restrictions for the CDC data:The data should only be used for health statistical reporting and analysis. For sub-national geography, I should not present or publish death counts of 9 or fewer or death rates based on counts of nine or fewer (in figures, graphs, maps, tables, etc.). I should also make no attempt to learn the identity of any person or establishment included in these data, and if an identity is discovered inadvertently, I should make no disclosure or other use of the identity and advise the NCHS Confidentiality Officer of any such discovery.Restrictions on data usage:https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D140;jsessionid=A6D2C355451B5F7AA02FF2857DEA8834## Data Use Restrictions for the NSDUH data:I should use these datasets solely for research or statistical purposes and not for re-identification of specific research subjects, and I should make no use of the identity of any research subject discovered inadvertently and report any such discovery to the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ) and to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive (SAMHDA) to the SAMHDA Help Desk. If I have any publications that use Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) data, I need to reference the recommended bibliographic citation.Restrictions on data usage:https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/info/terms-use-nid3422
